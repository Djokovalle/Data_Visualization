# Work on Geo-Map
## Historical examples

Trellis Graphics is a family of techniques for viewing complex, multi-variable data sets. The ideas have been around for a while, but were formalized by researchers at Bell Laboratories during the 1990s.
The techniques were given the name Trellis because they usually result in a rectangular array of plots,resembling a garden trellis.

Trellis plots are based on the idea of conditioning on the
values taken on by one or more of the variables in a data
set: 
- Categorical variables: Same plot for the data subsets corresponding to
each of the levels of that variable
- Numeric variables: Same plot the data subsets corresponding to intervals of
that variable.

Furthermore, they is a variety of displays which can be produced by Trellis:
– Bar Charts
– Dot Charts
– Box and Whisker Plots
– Histograms
– Density Traces
– QQ Plots
– Scatter Plots
Therefore they are extremely adaptable, which in term makes it a suitable visualization for a vast range of data.

- The plot is read left-to-right and bottom-to-top.
- Depth increases progressively through the plot.
- There are eight different depth intervals, each containing
approximately the same number of earthquakes.
- Consecutive depth intervals overlap by a small amount.
- The range of depths covered by each interval is
indicated in the bar above each plot.

This example illustrates the yields obtained from field trials of barley seed. In total it displayes 
120 observations over an period of 2 years. Because of the superimposion of the 2 years for multiple strains. 
The advatange of multiple information. It gives a straight foward overview on the evolution and for different experiments in a way that allows one to determine first correlations.
