# Work on Geo-Map
## Historical examples

Trellis Graphics is a family of techniques for viewing complex, multi-variable data sets. The ideas have been around for a while, but were formalized by researchers at Bell Laboratories during the 1990s.
The techniques were given the name Trellis because they usually result in a rectangular array of plots,resembling a garden trellis.

Trellis plots are based on the idea of conditioning on the
values taken on by one or more of the variables in a data
set: 
- Categorical variables: Same plot for the data subsets corresponding to
each of the levels of that variable
- Numeric variables: Same plot the data subsets corresponding to intervals of
that variable.
Furthermore, they is a variety of displays which can be produced by Trellis:
– Bar Charts
– Dot Charts
– Box and Whisker Plots
– Histograms
– Density Traces
– QQ Plots
– Scatter Plots
Examples:

Trellis 

- The plot is read left-to-right and bottom-to-top.
- Depth increases progressively through the plot.
- There are eight different depth intervals, each containing
approximately the same number of earthquakes.
- Consecutive depth intervals overlap by a small amount.
- The range of depths covered by each interval is
indicated in the bar above each plot.
